A company specializing in remote surveying and GIS solutions has grown steadily and now wants to upgrade and formalize its IT systems.

  - The company has two main types of users:
   - GIS Software Engineers, who work in a central office and use powerful workstations running ArcGIS.
    - These systems need to automatically back up to the central NAS in the office, available as a network drive.
    - GIS Engineers will occasionally need to remotely connect to these systems
    
   - Surveyors, who will work overseas for weeks at a time and use toughbooks running Linux Mint and specialized surveying software.
    - These systems need to automatically backup all data to a second internal hard drive.
    
# Project Scope

Determine which features make up your minimum viable product (MVP). This should include any features you absolutely want to have in your application for presentation day.

Why:

    Scope creep can be dangerous! Keeping your project within a pre-determined scope will help the group stay on task without going off on tangents and side         features.

Beyond MVP, put together a list of stretch goals to tackle if you have time. During your pitch, your instructor will help you scope your project. Some features may become MVP and some may become stretch goals.

Each member of the team must have a speaking part. It is okay to use note cards if you are nervous about forgetting what to talk about. Some of the areas to discuss include:

An introduction of the project and the problem domain, including the team's solution
A demonstration of the final product: highlight your organization, functionality, and all deliverables from the requirements
The team's approach to planning and communication throughout the project
A technical obstacle or two and how those obstacles were overcome
A portion of the final application that each team member is particularly proud of
