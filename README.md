A company specializing in remote surveying and GIS solutions has grown steadily and now wants to upgrade and formalize its IT systems.
  - The company has two main types of users:
   - GIS Software Engineers, who work in a central office and use powerful workstations running ArcGIS.
    - These systems need to automatically back up to the central NAS in the office, available as a network drive.
    - GIS Engineers will occasionally need to remotely connect to these systems
   - Surveyors, who will work overseas for weeks at a time and use toughbooks running Linux Mint and specialized surveying software.
    - These systems need to automatically backup all data to a second internal hard drive.
